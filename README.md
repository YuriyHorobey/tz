This is special repo for all my test-tasks during various job interviews.
However during merge of different projects into one repo.. seems I've spoiled something.
I'll fix it when I have time.

Meanwhile consider it to be code samples / my approach to code orginaizing done in some hours at evening on client's demand.
Some tecnologies like Angular-2 & TypeScript where completelly new to me so I've been learning while coding )))

Cheers,
Yuriy
